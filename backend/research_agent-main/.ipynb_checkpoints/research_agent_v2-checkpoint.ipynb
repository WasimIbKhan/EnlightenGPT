Max Weber, who proposed these concepts, viewed traditional authority as stable, impersonal, and nonrational, while rational-legal authority was seen as stable, impersonal, and rational. Charismatic authority, which results from extraordinary personal characteristics of a leader, was considered unstable, personal, and nonrational. Weber saw these three types of authority as forces that bring either stability and order (traditional/legal rational) or change and disorder (charismatic) to institutions and society. However, in the modern era, with new organizational structures and practices, the relevance of Weber's notion of authority may have changed.\u001b[39m\n",

      "Traditional authority, as defined by Max Weber, is characterized by its basis in customs and traditions that are passed down through generations. This form of authority can be observed in tribal chiefs, feudal lords, and monarchs. It is considered stable, impersonal, and nonrational in nature. In contrast, rational-legal authority is established through the enforcement of laws, rules, and the power derived from legitimate positions or offices. Weber notably identified bureaucracy as a prime example of rational-legal authority. Lastly, charismatic authority arises from the exceptional personal qualities of a leader that have the ability to inspire others. Charismatic authority is known for its instability, personal nature, and nonrational aspects. Weber viewed these three types of authority as influential forces that either bring stability and order (traditional/legal rational) or change and disorder (charismatic) to institutions and society. By understanding the characteristics of traditional authority, we gain insight into the role of customs and traditions in shaping power dynamics and the stability they can provide in certain cultural or religious contexts.\n",

      "Rational-legal authority differs from traditional authority in terms of its basis because it is founded upon laws, rules, and the power stemming from a legitimate position or office. Traditional authority, on the other hand, is based on customs and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next.
