      "According to Max Weber's notion of authority, traditional authority is characterized by its foundation in customs and traditions that are passed down through generations. This type of authority is stable, impersonal, and nonrational. It can be observed in figures such as tribal chiefs, feudal lords, and monarchs, who derive their power from long-standing customs and traditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, rational-legal authority is based on laws, rules, and the power derived from holding a legitimate position or office. Weber viewed the bureaucracy as a prime example of rational-legal authority. This type of authority provides stability and order within institutions and society. Unlike traditional authority, rational-legal authority is impersonal and rational, as it is rooted in formal structures and regulations that govern a society or organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of the basis of power, traditional authority relies on the acceptance and adherence to long-standing customs, while rational-legal authority derives its power from the formal structures and regulations that govern a society or organization. Traditional authority is deeply rooted in the past and is often resistant to change, while rational-legal authority is based on a system of rules and regulations that provide a framework for decision-making and governance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, charismatic authority arises from the exceptional personal characteristics of a leader that have the ability to inspire others. This type of authority is characterized by its instability, personal nature, and nonrationality. Charismatic authority can be observed in various fields such as politics, business, and entertainment, where influential leaders possess the ability to inspire and motivate others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Max Weber's notion of authority distinguishes between three types: traditional, rational-legal, and charismatic. Traditional authority is based on customs and traditions, providing stability and nonrationality. Rational-legal authority is founded upon laws, rules, and the power derived from holding a legitimate position or office, offering stability and rationality. Charismatic authority arises from exceptional personal characteristics, resulting in instability and nonrationality. These different types of authority shape power dynamics and leadership in society and organizations.\n",
